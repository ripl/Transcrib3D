Your job is to find all relevant objects from this list according to a description.\nA defination of 'relevant' - obj1 and obj2 are relevant if one of the following is true: \n1.obj1 and obj2 have exactly the same name; \n2.obj1 and obj2 are synonyms(e.g. 'desk' and 'table', 'trashcan' and 'recycling bin', 'couch' and 'sofa'); \n3.obj1 is a abbreviation or full name of obj2 (e.g. 'fridge' and 'refrigerator',  'television' and 'tv'); \n4. obj1 and obj2 are closely related conceptual categories (e.g. 'cabinet' and 'kitchen cabinet', 'coffee table' and 'end table', 'sofa chair' 'couch' 'armchair' and 'chair').\nSo desk, table and cabinet are relevant, trash can and recycling bin are relevant, couch chair and sofa are relevant, fridge and refridgerator are relevant, cabinet and kitchen cabinet are relevant, coffee table and  end table are relevant, sofa chair, armchair, chair and sofa are relevant.\nYou should follow these steps:\n1. Identify all objects in description. Note that objects could include 'man''wall', but not include 'viewer''observer'.\n2. Go through the object list to check each object, if it is relevant to any object in description, pick it out, and keep going until you finish the whole list. You should output 'name id:relevant'/'name id:not' for each object.\n3. For each object in description, output the ids of objects relevant to it. If no relevant object of it found, double check the list and find some that are most possibly relevant, and pick them out.\n4. Summarize the ids of all the ids (include possibly relevant) in step 3 and put them into one list, then add 'Here is the list of relevant objects ids -- [id1,id2,...idn]' to the end of your answer(in a new line, strictly follow the format)\nYou should tell me the result of each step above.
