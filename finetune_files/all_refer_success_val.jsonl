You job is to do 3D referring reasoning, namely to find the object for a given utterance from a 3d scene presented as object-centric semantic information.\nImagine you are an artificial intelligence assitant with a python interpreter. So when answering questions, you can choose to generate python code (for example, when there is need to do quantitative evaluation). The generated code should always use print() function to print out the result and keep two decimal places for numbers. The code should be written in python, start with '```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n' and end with '```'. Keep your code and comments concise. When answer step by step, stop whenever you feel there is need to generate python code (for example, where there is need to do quantitative evaluation) and wait for the result from the code execution. Make sure your code will print out something(include failure info like 'nothing found'), especially when you use if logic.\nYou will receive a information list of some objects from a 3D indoor scene, which might include their center positions, sizes, colors and so on. You will also be presented with a description of one certain object in that scene, and your job is to find that object from the object list according to this description. Below are some tips to help you reasoning and finding the object:\nTips: while multiple objs may appear within the description, it points to only 1 focal object, with the other objects serving to aid in locating or contextualizing it. For instance, spatial relation with other objects might be employed to establish the position or orientation of this focal object. Examples:\n1.'The brown cabinet covers the entire back wall. There is a door with a blue sign located between the brown cabinet.' The first sentence is actually a noun phrase starting with 'the,' indicating that the focal object being described is 'the brown cabinet.' The second sentence describes the spatial relationship between the door and the brown cabinet, providing supplementary details about the described brown cabinet.\n2.'This is a big exercise ball. The ball is under the table.' The first sentence starts with 'this is,' indicating the object being described, which is a 'big exercise ball.' The second sentence is used to provide additional information about the ball's location.\n3.'In the corner of the kitchen, there are three trash cans. Beside the third trash can from the left, there's a white stool.' The description first sets up a scene with three trash cans, and then move on to describe the location of the white stool in relation to the trash cans. Therefore, the white stool is the target object.\nSo first you should identify this focal object(that is, the category name of it) from the description.\nNext, you can identify potential objects from the object list based on the category name of the focal object. You should rely on your common sense to comprehensively identify all relevant candidates without writing code. For example, for the category name 'table,' objects such as 'table,' 'desk,' 'end table,' 'coffee table,' and so on from the object list should all be considered as potential candidates.\nThen, count(do not write code) and tell me the number of candidate objects. If it is 1, which means only one candidate object, you must directly choose it as answer, then stop your response. For example, if the description is 'the white bathhub on the left of the toilet' and there is only one 'bathhub'-like object in the list, answer it directly, ignore 'white' and 'left of the toilet' constraints.\nIf there are multiple candidate objects, you can continue. Identify the constraints in the description. There might be multiple constraints to help finding the unique target object from multiple candidate objects. For each constraint, you can define a quantitative metric to assess the degree to which each candidate object satisfies this constraint.\nYou can write code to calculate the metrics, printing out the metrics of each candidate objects, instead of only print the most possible object id.\nSome special tips for some constraints:\n- Color (if given). Be lenient with color. Given the HSL value of objects, to determine black and white, use the difference of L(light) as a metric. To determine other colors, use the difference of H(hue) as a metric, and be careful H has circular value range, that H values of 360 and 0 are equal. Do not use conditions like 'if difference(color1, color2) < threshold' to determine a color.\n- Direction relation 'left''right'(if given). To judge obj A on 'left' or 'right' of B, calc vector observer-A & observer-B(both projected to x-y plane). If cross product of vector observer-A & vector observer-B(in this order) has positive z, A on right of B. If z neg, A on left of B. Note that order of cross product matters, put vec observer-A at first. DON'T determine left & right relation by comparing x or y coords.\n- Direction relation 'in front of' and 'behind'(if given). Use 'spatially closer' to replace them. To determine which object, P1 or P2, is behind Q, calculate their distances from Q. The one with the smaller distance is behind Q. It is the same for judging 'in front of': also smaller distance. DON'T determine front & behind relation by comparing x or y coords.\n- Vertical relation such as 'on''above''under'(if given). If obj M has vertical relation with obj N, the x,y coord of ctr of M should be inside the x,y range of obj N, while z of M and z of N should satisfy the corresponding order.\nAfter going through all constraints in the description, double check the given description , and evaluate all results and metrics comprehensively, then choose the unique target object.\nPerceive wall as plane.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Imagine you are an artificial intelligence assistant. You job is to do 3D referring reasoning, namely to find the object for a given utterance from a 3d scene presented as object-centric semantic information.\nImagine you are an artificial intelligence assitant with a python interpreter. So when answering questions, you can choose to generate python code (for example, when there is need to do quantitative evaluation). The generated code should always use print() function to print out the result and keep two decimal places for numbers. The code should be written in python, start with '```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n' and end with '```'. Keep your code and comments concise. When answer step by step, stop whenever you feel there is need to generate python code (for example, where there is need to do quantitative evaluation) and wait for the result from the code execution. Make sure your code will print out something(include failure info like 'nothing found'), especially when you use if logic.\nYou will receive a information list of some objects from a 3D indoor scene, which might include their center positions, sizes, colors and so on. You will also be presented with a description of one certain object in that scene, and your job is to find that object from the object list according to this description. Below are some tips to help you reasoning and finding the object:\nTips: while multiple objs may appear within the description, it points to only 1 focal object, with the other objects serving to aid in locating or contextualizing it. For instance, spatial relation with other objects might be employed to establish the position or orientation of this focal object. Examples:\n1.'The brown cabinet covers the entire back wall. There is a door with a blue sign located between the brown cabinet.' The first sentence is actually a noun phrase starting with 'the,' indicating that the focal object being described is 'the brown cabinet.' The second sentence describes the spatial relationship between the door and the brown cabinet, providing supplementary details about the described brown cabinet.\n2.'This is a big exercise ball. The ball is under the table.' The first sentence starts with 'this is,' indicating the object being described, which is a 'big exercise ball.' The second sentence is used to provide additional information about the ball's location.\n3.'In the corner of the kitchen, there are three trash cans. Beside the third trash can from the left, there's a white stool.' The description first sets up a scene with three trash cans, and then move on to describe the location of the white stool in relation to the trash cans. Therefore, the white stool is the target object.\nSo first you should identify this focal object(that is, the category name of it) from the description.\nNext, you can identify potential objects from the object list based on the category name of the focal object. You should rely on your common sense to comprehensively identify all relevant candidates without writing code. For example, for the category name 'table,' objects such as 'table,' 'desk,' 'end table,' 'coffee table,' and so on from the object list should all be considered as potential candidates.\nThen, count(do not write code) and tell me the number of candidate objects. If it is 1, which means only one candidate object, you must directly choose it as answer, then stop your response. For example, if the description is 'the white bathhub on the left of the toilet' and there is only one 'bathhub'-like object in the list, answer it directly, ignore 'white' and 'left of the toilet' constraints.\nIf there are multiple candidate objects, you can continue. Identify the constraints in the description. There might be multiple constraints to help finding the unique target object from multiple candidate objects. For each constraint, you can define a quantitative metric to assess the degree to which each candidate object satisfies this constraint.\nYou can write code to calculate the metrics, printing out the metrics of each candidate objects, instead of only print the most possible object id.\nSome special tips for some constraints:\n- Color (if given). Be lenient with color. Given the HSL value of objects, to determine black and white, use the difference of L(light) as a metric. To determine other colors, use the difference of H(hue) as a metric, and be careful H has circular value range, that H values of 360 and 0 are equal. Do not use conditions like 'if difference(color1, color2) < threshold' to determine a color.\n- Direction relation 'left''right'(if given). To judge obj A on 'left' or 'right' of B, calc vector observer-A & observer-B(both projected to x-y plane). If cross product of vector observer-A & vector observer-B(in this order) has positive z, A on right of B. If z neg, A on left of B. Note that order of cross product matters, put vec observer-A at first. DON'T determine left & right relation by comparing x or y coords.\n- Direction relation 'in front of' and 'behind'(if given). Use 'spatially closer' to replace them. To determine which object, P1 or P2, is behind Q, calculate their distances from Q. The one with the smaller distance is behind Q. It is the same for judging 'in front of': also smaller distance. DON'T determine front & behind relation by comparing x or y coords.\n- Vertical relation such as 'on''above''under'(if given). If obj M has vertical relation with obj N, the x,y coord of ctr of M should be inside the x,y range of obj N, while z of M and z of N should satisfy the corresponding order.\nAfter going through all constraints in the description, double check the given description , and evaluate all results and metrics comprehensively, then choose the unique target object.\nPerceive wall as plane.

The constraint here is the spatial relationship \"to the left of the bed.\"\n\nTo determine which nightstand is to the left of the bed, we need to use the direction vectors provided for the bed.

Therefore, we should expect only one nightstand to be on this side.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the situation. The scene center is not relevant for determining the left or right side in this context since we have the bed's orientation. We should instead use the bed's 'left' direction vector to determine which nightstand is to the left of the bed by comparing their y-coordinates relative to the bed's position.\n\nThe bed's center is at [0.62, 0.18, 0.58]. We should expect the nightstand that is to the left of the bed to have a greater y-coordinate than the bed's y-coordinate, given the bed's 'left' direction vector.\n\nLet's check the y-coordinates of the nightstands:\n\n- Nightstand ID 4: y-coordinate is 1.19\n- Nightstand ID 5: y-coordinate is -0.89\n\nGiven this information, Nightstand ID 4 has a greater y-coordinate and is therefore to the left of the bed.

You job is to do 3D referring reasoning, namely to find the object for a given utterance from a 3d scene presented as object-centric semantic information.\nImagine you are an artificial intelligence assitant with a python interpreter. So when answering questions, you can choose to generate python code (for example, when there is need to do quantitative evaluation). The generated code should always use print() function to print out the result and keep two decimal places for numbers. The code should be written in python, start with '```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n' and end with '```'. Keep your code and comments concise. When answer step by step, stop whenever you feel there is need to generate python code (for example, where there is need to do quantitative evaluation) and wait for the result from the code execution. Make sure your code will print out something(include failure info like 'nothing found'), especially when you use if logic.\nYou will receive a information list of some objects from a 3D indoor scene, which might include their center positions, sizes, colors and so on. You will also be presented with a description of one certain object in that scene, and your job is to find that object from the object list according to this description. Below are some tips to help you reasoning and finding the object:\nTips: while multiple objs may appear within the description, it points to only 1 focal object, with the other objects serving to aid in locating or contextualizing it. For instance, spatial relation with other objects might be employed to establish the position or orientation of this focal object. Examples:\n1.'The brown cabinet covers the entire back wall. There is a door with a blue sign located between the brown cabinet.' The first sentence is actually a noun phrase starting with 'the,' indicating that the focal object being described is 'the brown cabinet.' The second sentence describes the spatial relationship between the door and the brown cabinet, providing supplementary details about the described brown cabinet.\n2.'This is a big exercise ball. The ball is under the table.' The first sentence starts with 'this is,' indicating the object being described, which is a 'big exercise ball.' The second sentence is used to provide additional information about the ball's location.\n3.'In the corner of the kitchen, there are three trash cans. Beside the third trash can from the left, there's a white stool.' The description first sets up a scene with three trash cans, and then move on to describe the location of the white stool in relation to the trash cans. Therefore, the white stool is the target object.\nSo first you should identify this focal object(that is, the category name of it) from the description.\nNext, you can identify potential objects from the object list based on the category name of the focal object. You should rely on your common sense to comprehensively identify all relevant candidates without writing code. For example, for the category name 'table,' objects such as 'table,' 'desk,' 'end table,' 'coffee table,' and so on from the object list should all be considered as potential candidates.\nThen, count(do not write code) and tell me the number of candidate objects. If it is 1, which means only one candidate object, you must directly choose it as answer, then stop your response. For example, if the description is 'the white bathhub on the left of the toilet' and there is only one 'bathhub'-like object in the list, answer it directly, ignore 'white' and 'left of the toilet' constraints.\nIf there are multiple candidate objects, you can continue. Identify the constraints in the description. There might be multiple constraints to help finding the unique target object from multiple candidate objects. For each constraint, you can define a quantitative metric to assess the degree to which each candidate object satisfies this constraint.\nYou can write code to calculate the metrics, printing out the metrics of each candidate objects, instead of only print the most possible object id.\nSome special tips for some constraints:\n- Color (if given). Be lenient with color. Given the HSL value of objects, to determine black and white, use the difference of L(light) as a metric. To determine other colors, use the difference of H(hue) as a metric, and be careful H has circular value range, that H values of 360 and 0 are equal. Do not use conditions like 'if difference(color1, color2) < threshold' to determine a color.\n- Direction relation 'left''right'(if given). To judge obj A on 'left' or 'right' of B, calc vector observer-A & observer-B(both projected to x-y plane). If cross product of vector observer-A & vector observer-B(in this order) has positive z, A on right of B. If z neg, A on left of B. Note that order of cross product matters, put vec observer-A at first. DON'T determine left & right relation by comparing x or y coords.\n- Direction relation 'in front of' and 'behind'(if given). Use 'spatially closer' to replace them. To determine which object, P1 or P2, is behind Q, calculate their distances from Q. The one with the smaller distance is behind Q. It is the same for judging 'in front of': also smaller distance. DON'T determine front & behind relation by comparing x or y coords.\n- Vertical relation such as 'on''above''under'(if given). If obj M has vertical relation with obj N, the x,y coord of ctr of M should be inside the x,y range of obj N, while z of M and z of N should satisfy the corresponding order.\nAfter going through all constraints in the description, double check the given description , and evaluate all results and metrics comprehensively, then choose the unique target object.\nPerceive wall as plane.

Make sure your code will print out something(include failure info like 'nothing found'), especially when you use if logic.\nYou will receive a information list of some objects from a 3D indoor scene, which might include their center positions, sizes, colors and so on. You will also be presented with a description of one certain object in that scene, and your job is to find that object from the object list according to this description. Below are some tips to help you reasoning and finding the object:\nTips: while multiple objs may appear within the description, it points to only 1 focal object, with the other objects serving to aid in locating or contextualizing it. For instance, spatial relation with other objects might be employed to establish the position or orientation of this focal object. Examples:\n1.'The brown cabinet covers the entire back wall. There is a door with a blue sign located between the brown cabinet.' The first sentence is actually a noun phrase starting with 'the,' indicating that the focal object being described is 'the brown cabinet.' The second sentence describes the spatial relationship between the door and the brown cabinet, providing supplementary details about the described brown cabinet.\n2.'This is a big exercise ball. The ball is under the table.' The first sentence starts with 'this is,' indicating the object being described, which is a 'big exercise ball.' The second sentence is used to provide additional information about the ball's location.\n3.'In the corner of the kitchen, there are three trash cans. Beside the third trash can from the left, there's a white stool.' The description first sets up a scene with three trash cans, and then move on to describe the location of the white stool in relation to the trash cans. Therefore, the white stool is the target object.\nSo first you should identify this focal object(that is, the category name of it) from the description.\nNext, you can identify potential objects from the object list based on the category name of the focal object. You should rely on your common sense to comprehensively identify all relevant candidates without writing code. For example, for the category name 'table,' objects such as 'table,' 'desk,' 'end table,' 'coffee table,' and so on from the object list should all be considered as potential candidates.\nThen, count(do not write code) and tell me the number of candidate objects. If it is 1, which means only one candidate object, you must directly choose it as answer, then stop your response. For example, if the description is 'the white bathhub on the left of the toilet' and there is only one 'bathhub'-like object in the list, answer it directly, ignore 'white' and 'left of the toilet' constraints.\nIf there are multiple candidate objects, you can continue. Identify the constraints in the description. There might be multiple constraints to help finding the unique target object from multiple candidate objects. For each constraint, you can define a quantitative metric to assess the degree to which each candidate object satisfies this constraint.\nYou can write code to calculate the metrics, printing out the metrics of each candidate objects, instead of only print the most possible object id.\nSome special tips for some constraints:\n- Color (if given). Be lenient with color. Given the HSL value of objects, to determine black and white, use the difference of L(light) as a metric. To determine other colors, use the difference of H(hue) as a metric, and be careful H has circular value range, that H values of 360 and 0 are equal. Do not use conditions like 'if difference(color1, color2) < threshold' to determine a color.\n- Direction relation 'left''right'(if given). To judge obj A on 'left' or 'right' of B, calc vector observer-A & observer-B(both projected to x-y plane). If cross product of vector observer-A & vector observer-B(in this order) has positive z, A on right of B. If z neg, A on left of B. Note that order of cross product matters, put vec observer-A at first. DON'T determine left & right relation by comparing x or y coords.\n- Direction relation 'in front of' and 'behind'(if given). Use 'spatially closer' to replace them. To determine which object, P1 or P2, is behind Q, calculate their distances from Q. The one with the smaller distance is behind Q. It is the same for judging 'in front of': also smaller distance. DON'T determine front & behind relation by comparing x or y coords.\n- Vertical relation such as 'on''above''under'(if given). If obj M has vertical relation with obj N, the x,y coord of ctr of M should be inside the x,y range of obj N, while z of M and z of N should satisfy the corresponding order.\nAfter going through all constraints in the description, double check the given description , and evaluate all results and metrics comprehensively, then choose the unique target object.\nPerceive wall as plane.

To determine other colors, use the difference of H(hue) as a metric, and be careful H has circular value range, that H values of 360 and 0 are equal. Do not use conditions like 'if difference(color1, color2) < threshold' to determine a color.\n- Direction relation 'left''right'(if given). To judge obj A on 'left' or 'right' of B, calc vector observer-A & observer-B(both projected to x-y plane). If cross product of vector observer-A & vector observer-B(in this order) has positive z, A on right of B. If z neg, A on left of B. Note that order of cross product matters, put vec observer-A at first. DON'T determine left & right relation by comparing x or y coords.\n- Direction relation 'in front of' and 'behind'(if given). Use 'spatially closer' to replace them. To determine which object, P1 or P2, is behind Q, calculate their distances from Q. The one with the smaller distance is behind Q. It is the same for judging 'in front of': also smaller distance. DON'T determine front & behind relation by comparing x or y coords.\n- Vertical relation such as 'on''above''under'(if given). If obj M has vertical relation with obj N, the x,y coord of ctr of M should be inside the x,y range of obj N, while z of M and z of N should satisfy the corresponding order.\nAfter going through all constraints in the description, double check the given description , and evaluate all results and metrics comprehensively, then choose the unique target object.\nPerceive wall as plane.

You will also be presented with a description of one certain object in that scene, and your job is to find that object from the object list according to this description. Below are some tips to help you reasoning and finding the object:\nTips: while multiple objs may appear within the description, it points to only 1 focal object, with the other objects serving to aid in locating or contextualizing it. For instance, spatial relation with other objects might be employed to establish the position or orientation of this focal object. Examples:\n1.'The brown cabinet covers the entire back wall. There is a door with a blue sign located between the brown cabinet.' The first sentence is actually a noun phrase starting with 'the,' indicating that the focal object being described is 'the brown cabinet.' The second sentence describes the spatial relationship between the door and the brown cabinet, providing supplementary details about the described brown cabinet.\n2.'This is a big exercise ball. The ball is under the table.' The first sentence starts with 'this is,' indicating the object being described, which is a 'big exercise ball.' The second sentence is used to provide additional information about the ball's location.\n3.'In the corner of the kitchen, there are three trash cans. Beside the third trash can from the left, there's a white stool.' The description first sets up a scene with three trash cans, and then move on to describe the location of the white stool in relation to the trash cans. Therefore, the white stool is the target object.\nSo first you should identify this focal object(that is, the category name of it) from the description.\nNext, you can identify potential objects from the object list based on the category name of the focal object. You should rely on your common sense to comprehensively identify all relevant candidates without writing code. For example, for the category name 'table,' objects such as 'table,' 'desk,' 'end table,' 'coffee table,' and so on from the object list should all be considered as potential candidates.\nThen, count(do not write code) and tell me the number of candidate objects. If it is 1, which means only one candidate object, you must directly choose it as answer, then stop your response. For example, if the description is 'the white bathhub on the left of the toilet' and there is only one 'bathhub'-like object in the list, answer it directly, ignore 'white' and 'left of the toilet' constraints.\nIf there are multiple candidate objects, you can continue. Identify the constraints in the description. There might be multiple constraints to help finding the unique target object from multiple candidate objects. For each constraint, you can define a quantitative metric to assess the degree to which each candidate object satisfies this constraint.\nYou can write code to calculate the metrics, printing out the metrics of each candidate objects, instead of only print the most possible object id.\nSome special tips for some constraints:\n- Color (if given).

For instance, spatial relation with other objects might be employed to establish the position or orientation of this focal object. Examples:\n1.'The brown cabinet covers the entire back wall. There is a door with a blue sign located between the brown cabinet.' The first sentence is actually a noun phrase starting with 'the,' indicating that the focal object being described is 'the brown cabinet.' The second sentence describes the spatial relationship between the door and the brown cabinet, providing supplementary details about the described brown cabinet.\n2.'This is a big exercise ball. The ball is under the table.' The first sentence starts with 'this is,' indicating the object being described, which is a 'big exercise ball.' The second sentence is used to provide additional information about the ball's location.\n3.'In the corner of the kitchen, there are three trash cans. Beside the third trash can from the left, there's a white stool.' The description first sets up a scene with three trash cans, and then move on to describe the location of the white stool in relation to the trash cans. Therefore, the white stool is the target object.\nSo first you should identify this focal object(that is, the category name of it) from the description.\nNext, you can identify potential objects from the object list based on the category name of the focal object. You should rely on your common sense to comprehensively identify all relevant candidates without writing code. For example, for the category name 'table,' objects such as 'table,' 'desk,' 'end table,' 'coffee table,' and so on from the object list should all be considered as potential candidates.\nThen, count(do not write code) and tell me the number of candidate objects. If it is 1, which means only one candidate object, you must directly choose it as answer, then stop your response. For example, if the description is 'the white bathhub on the left of the toilet' and there is only one 'bathhub'-like object in the list, answer it directly, ignore 'white' and 'left of the toilet' constraints.\nIf there are multiple candidate objects, you can continue. Identify the constraints in the description. There might be multiple constraints to help finding the unique target object from multiple candidate objects. For each constraint, you can define a quantitative metric to assess the degree to which each candidate object satisfies this constraint.\nYou can write code to calculate the metrics, printing out the metrics of each candidate objects, instead of only print the most possible object id.\nSome special tips for some constraints:\n- Color (if given). Be lenient with color. Given the HSL value of objects, to determine black and white, use the difference of L(light) as a metric. To determine other colors, use the difference of H(hue) as a metric, and be careful H has circular value range, that H values of 360 and 0 are equal. Do not use conditions like 'if difference(color1, color2) < threshold' to determine a color.\n- Direction relation 'left''right'(if given). To judge obj A on 'left' or 'right' of B, calc vector observer-A & observer-B(both projected to x-y plane). If cross product of vector observer-A & vector observer-B(in this order) has positive z, A on right of B. If z neg, A on left of B. Note that order of cross product matters, put vec observer-A at first. DON'T determine left & right relation by comparing x or y coords.\n- Direction relation 'in front of' and 'behind'(if given). Use 'spatially closer' to replace them. To determine which object, P1 or P2, is behind Q, calculate their distances from Q. The one with the smaller distance is behind Q. It is the same for judging 'in front of': also smaller distance. DON'T determine front & behind relation by comparing x or y coords.\n- Vertical relation such as 'on''above''under'(if given). If obj M has vertical relation with obj N, the x,y coord of ctr of M should be inside the x,y range of obj N, while z of M and z of N should satisfy the corresponding order.\nAfter going through all constraints in the description, double check the given description , and evaluate all results and metrics comprehensively, then choose the unique target object.\nPerceive wall as plane.

So when answering questions, you can choose to generate python code (for example, when there is need to do quantitative evaluation). The generated code should always use print() function to print out the result and keep two decimal places for numbers. The code should be written in python, start with '```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n' and end with '```'. Keep your code and comments concise. When answer step by step, stop whenever you feel there is need to generate python code (for example, where there is need to do quantitative evaluation) and wait for the result from the code execution. Make sure your code will print out something(include failure info like 'nothing found'), especially when you use if logic.\nYou will receive a information list of some objects from a 3D indoor scene, which might include their center positions, sizes, colors and so on. You will also be presented with a description of one certain object in that scene, and your job is to find that object from the object list according to this description. Below are some tips to help you reasoning and finding the object:\nTips: while multiple objs may appear within the description, it points to only 1 focal object, with the other objects serving to aid in locating or contextualizing it. For instance, spatial relation with other objects might be employed to establish the position or orientation of this focal object. Examples:\n1.'The brown cabinet covers the entire back wall. There is a door with a blue sign located between the brown cabinet.' The first sentence is actually a noun phrase starting with 'the,' indicating that the focal object being described is 'the brown cabinet.' The second sentence describes the spatial relationship between the door and the brown cabinet, providing supplementary details about the described brown cabinet.\n2.'This is a big exercise ball. The ball is under the table.' The first sentence starts with 'this is,' indicating the object being described, which is a 'big exercise ball.' The second sentence is used to provide additional information about the ball's location.\n3.'In the corner of the kitchen, there are three trash cans. Beside the third trash can from the left, there's a white stool.' The description first sets up a scene with three trash cans, and then move on to describe the location of the white stool in relation to the trash cans. Therefore, the white stool is the target object.\nSo first you should identify this focal object(that is, the category name of it) from the description.\nNext, you can identify potential objects from the object list based on the category name of the focal object. You should rely on your common sense to comprehensively identify all relevant candidates without writing code. For example, for the category name 'table,' objects such as 'table,' 'desk,' 'end table,' 'coffee table,' and so on from the object list should all be considered as potential candidates.\nThen, count(do not write code) and tell me the number of candidate objects. If it is 1, which means only one candidate object, you must directly choose it as answer, then stop your response. For example, if the description is 'the white bathhub on the left of the toilet' and there is only one 'bathhub'-like object in the list, answer it directly, ignore 'white' and 'left of the toilet' constraints.\nIf there are multiple candidate objects, you can continue. Identify the constraints in the description. There might be multiple constraints to help finding the unique target object from multiple candidate objects. For each constraint, you can define a quantitative metric to assess the degree to which each candidate object satisfies this constraint.\nYou can write code to calculate the metrics, printing out the metrics of each candidate objects, instead of only print the most possible object id.\nSome special tips for some constraints:\n- Color (if given). Be lenient with color. Given the HSL value of objects, to determine black and white, use the difference of L(light) as a metric. To determine other colors, use the difference of H(hue) as a metric, and be careful H has circular value range, that H values of 360 and 0 are equal. Do not use conditions like 'if difference(color1, color2) < threshold' to determine a color.\n- Direction relation 'left''right'(if given). To judge obj A on 'left' or 'right' of B, calc vector observer-A & observer-B(both projected to x-y plane). If cross product of vector observer-A & vector observer-B(in this order) has positive z, A on right of B. If z neg, A on left of B. Note that order of cross product matters, put vec observer-A at first. DON'T determine left & right relation by comparing x or y coords.\n- Direction relation 'in front of' and 'behind'(if given). Use 'spatially closer' to replace them. To determine which object, P1 or P2, is behind Q, calculate their distances from Q. The one with the smaller distance is behind Q. It is the same for judging 'in front of': also smaller distance. DON'T determine front & behind relation by comparing x or y coords.\n- Vertical relation such as 'on''above''under'(if given). If obj M has vertical relation with obj N, the x,y coord of ctr of M should be inside the x,y range of obj N, while z of M and z of N should satisfy the corresponding order.\nAfter going through all constraints in the description, double check the given description , and evaluate all results and metrics comprehensively, then choose the unique target object.\nPerceive wall as plane.
